# Project Overview

The application is a dual-interface solution consisting of:

- **Customer-Facing Scheduling Interface:** Enables small business owners (e.g., salons, restaurants) to manage appointments and reservations.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Provides high-level analytics and operational metrics such as upcoming appointments, revenue figures, and popular time slots.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Management & Authentication

- **Role-Based Access:** Implement distinct user roles (e.g., Admin, Business Owner) with granular permissions.
- **Secure Authentication:** Support secure login mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, two-factor authentication).

### 2. Appointment Management

- **CRUD Operations:** Allow users to create, read, update, and cancel appointments.
- **Calendar Integration:** Provide a calendar view to display appointments in real time with support for drag-and-drop rescheduling.
- **Real-Time Availability:** Display and update booking availability instantly to avoid conflicts.
- **Notifications:** Trigger email and/or SMS notifications for appointment confirmations, reminders, reschedules, and cancellations.

### 3. Payment & Order Management

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) to manage deposits or full payments for bookings.
- **Order Status Tracking:** Display payment and order statuses within the admin dashboard.

### 4. Dashboard & Analytics

- **High-Level Metrics Display:** Provide real-time graphs, charts, and statistics for:
  - Upcoming appointments
  - Total revenue generated
  - Popular time slots (usage trends)
- **Customizable Reports:** Enable filtering by date ranges, appointment types, and other parameters.
- **Data Export:** Allow exporting of booking and financial data (e.g., CSV, Excel).

### 5. API & Integrations

- **RESTful API:** Expose secure endpoints for integration with external systems (e.g., CRM, marketing tools).
- **Calendar and CRM Integrations:** Optional integrations with common calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook) and customer management platforms.

### 6. Responsive & Accessible UI

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the scheduling interface and admin dashboard are fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure the interface is accessible to all users.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance & Scalability

- **Response Time:** Ensure that all interactive elements (dashboard loading, calendar updates) respond within 2 seconds.
- **Concurrent Users:** Design to support scalability for a growing number of users and bookings (e.g., up to 10,000 concurrent appointments).
- **Load Balancing:** Utilize cloud-based load balancing to maintain performance during peak usage.

### 2. Security

- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
- **Regular Audits:** Implement periodic security audits and vulnerability scanning.
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).

### 3. Reliability & Maintainability

- **Uptime:** Target a 99.9% system uptime with automated failover and recovery processes.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate robust logging and performance monitoring (using tools like ELK Stack or similar).
- **Test Coverage:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Provide detailed developer documentation (API docs, system architecture) and user manuals.

### 4. Deployment & Extensibility

- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy on a scalable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, or Google Cloud) with CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates.
- **Modular Architecture:** Use a modular design to enable future feature enhancements and third-party integrations with minimal rework.

## Technical Stack & Architecture (Example)

- **Frontend:** React with responsive design frameworks (Shadcn-UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with RESTful API architecture
- **Database:** MongoDB for robust data management
- **Hosting/Cloud:** AWS/Azure with container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Security Tools:** Sessions for authentication, HTTPS for secure communication
